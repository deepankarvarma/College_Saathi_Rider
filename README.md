# College Saathi Rider App

Welcome to the College Saathi Rider App repository! This Flutter-based, cross-platform application is designed to make e-rickshaw booking within the campus a seamless and convenient experience for riders. The app utilizes GetX for state management, Flutter for dynamic UI, and Firebase as a Backend as a Service (BaaS) to handle authentication, real-time communication, and ride history.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform and Dynamic:** This app is developed using Flutter, making it cross-platform, allowing users to enjoy a consistent experience on both Android and iOS devices. The dynamic UI enhances user engagement and responsiveness.

- **Dual Theme Support:** The app offers both light and dark mode themes, ensuring a visually appealing experience for users in different environments.

- **Authentication:** Robust email validation and authentication methods are implemented to ensure secure access for users.

- **Campus Information:** Access details about college events, important contacts, and various vendor information right from the app.

- **Ride Requests:** Users can conveniently request rides by specifying the source and destination. The request is sent to available drivers who can then accept or reject based on their availability.

- **Real-time Communication:** Once a ride request is accepted, the rider and driver can view each other's details, facilitating a smooth pick-up process.

- **Ride History:** Completed rides are recorded in the ride history, providing users with a comprehensive overview of their travel activities.

- **Payment Integration (Under Development):** Payment methods are being added to enhance the user experience and provide a seamless transaction process.

- **Corner Case Handling:** Various edge cases are considered, such as preventing users from making multiple requests simultaneously and ensuring that only one driver can accept a particular request.
